### Packages

| [Sok.Buffer](-sok.-buffer/index.html) | As Sok is buffer based, you need to use buffers to perform I/O operations. The primitive for that is the `MultiplatformBuffer` class. This package also contains a basic implementation of a buffer pool for object recycling. |
| [Sok.Exceptions](-sok.-exceptions/index.html)<br>(Common) | Contains all the exception classes |
| [Sok.Selector](-sok.-selector/index.html) | Internal package containing selector-related classes for JVM and Native platforms. The only usefull methods for a developper are the `Seletor` companion object methods. |
| [Sok.Socket.TCP](-sok.-socket.-t-c-p/index.html) | Contains the heart of Sok. All the client and server socket classes are here |
| [Sok.Utils](-sok.-utils/index.html)<br>(Native) | Internal package with helper functions |
